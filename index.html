		<h1>Here's where landlords are evicting people for reasons other than nonpayment in NYC </h1>

		While evictions as a whole across New York City are down due to the eviction moratorium, numbers have been creeping back up since housing courts reopened on June 20. The eviction moratorium, extended to January 1, 2021, protects renters who cannot pay rent as a direct impact of COVID-19. But the moratorium still leaves gaps. Holdover evictions aren't protected by the moratoriumâ€”these are evictions for reasons like "if the tenant has violated a lease provision, illegally put others in the apartment, has become a nuisance to other tenants, or is staying after a lease has expired," <a href="https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/startingholdover.shtml#:~:text=A%20holdover%20case%20is%20brought,than%20simple%20nonpayment%20of%20rent.&text=A%20roommate%20who%20is%20named,the%20lease%20from%20the%20apartment.">according to NYCourts.Gov.</a> Data compiled by the state, acquired by the <a href="https://www.housingdatanyc.org/"> Housing Data Coalition</a>, shows that in a handful of NYC neighborhoods, holdover evictions account for a larger share of evictions than they did last year.
